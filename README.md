  2. Provision the server and deploy the app
    * cd into the repo and run `bundle exec berks install --path cookbooks/`
    * run `bundle exec knife solo prepare user@host` to prepare your server
    * modify the file `nodes/<yourhost>.json. there is an example JSON file in the same folder
    * run `bundle exec knife solo cook user@host` to install all dependencies on the server
    * Go drink some coffee, this takes some time
    * change the hostname in the `config/deploy/production.rb` file to your server
    * if you changed the default deploy paths in the `nodes/<yourhost>.json`, then change them also in `config/deploy.rb`
    * run `bundle exec cap production deploy` to deploy the app
